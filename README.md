Project Philosophy
Project Legacy was founded on a simple yet powerful idea: FIFA 23 can be more than just an arcade football game. It can be a deep, rewarding simulation that captures the strategy, emotion, and unpredictability of the real sport. We believe the base game provides a solid engine, but its potential is constrained by design choices that prioritize fast-paced, end-to-end action over tactical realism.

Our goal is to unlock that potential. Every change we make is deliberate, from adjusting player movement to rewriting transfer logic. We aim to create an experience where tactical decisions matter, where building a team feels meaningful, and where every match tells a unique story.

Key Features
Gameplay Overhaul
Tactical Match Pace: We've reduced the default game speed to encourage deliberate build-up play and strategic thinking.

Intelligent CPU AI: The AI is now more adaptable and less predictable. They will exploit your weaknesses, defend more cohesively, and vary their attacking approach based on the match situation.

Realistic Physics Engine: Reworked ball physics create more authentic trajectories, bounces, and deflections. Player animations are more fluid, leading to more natural interactions and fewer "scripted" moments.

Career Mode Enhancements
Dynamic Transfer System: Transfer logic and budgets have been completely overhauled to reflect real-world club finances and strategies. Don't expect to see small clubs making blockbuster signings.

Meaningful Player Development: Player growth is now more organic and tied to performance, age, and potential. Wonderkids won't skyrocket to 90+ ratings in two seasons without proving themselves on the pitch.

Revamped Youth System: Youth scouting is more challenging but also more rewarding. Unearthing a generational talent from your academy feels like a genuine achievement.



Visuals & Immersion
Authentic Presentation: The mod includes updated kits, balls, and boots for the latest season, alongside authentic broadcast packages to enhance the big-match feel.

Living Stadiums: We've added a wealth of new ad-boards, tifos, banners, and dynamic stadium lighting to make each venue feel unique and alive.



Installation Guide
Please follow these steps meticulously to ensure a successful installation.

Prerequisites:

A legitimate, clean installation of FIFA 23 (Steam or EA App).

The game must not be running during the installation process.

Installation Steps:

Backup Your Game Data:

Navigate to your FIFA 23 installation folder (e.g., C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\FIFA 23).

Create a backup of this entire folder. This is your failsafe to restore the vanilla game.

Download the Latest Release:

Download the .zip file from the latest version.

Extract the Mod Files:

Right-click the downloaded .zip file and select "Extract All..." or use a tool like 7-Zip or WinRAR.

Apply the Mod:

Open the extracted folder.

Copy all the files and folders within it.

Paste them directly into your main FIFA 23 game directory.

Overwrite Existing Files:

Windows will prompt you to replace files in the destination. You must select "Replace the files in the destination" for all conflicts.

Launch the Game:

Launch FIFA 23 as you normally would. The mod is now active.

Troubleshooting:

Game Crashes on Startup: This usually means a corrupted installation. Restore your backup and repeat the installation steps carefully.

Mod Features Not Appearing: Ensure you overwrote all files correctly. Some antivirus software can interfere; try temporarily disabling it during the copy process.
